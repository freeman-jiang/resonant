<p>Joel Spolsky has a classic blog post on &quot;Finding Great Developers&quot; where he popularized the meme that
    great developers are impossible to find, a corollary of which is that if you can find someone, they're not great.
    Joel writes,</p>
    <blockquote><p>The great software developers, indeed, the best people in every field, are quite simply never on the
        market.</p>
        <p>The average great software developer will apply for, total, maybe, four jobs in their entire career.</p>
        <p>...</p>
        <p>If you're lucky, if you're really lucky, they show up on the open job market once, when, say, their spouse
            decides to accept a medical internship in Anchorage and they actually send their resume out to what they
            think are the few places they'd like to work at in Anchorage.</p>
        <p>But for the most part, great developers (and this is almost a tautology) are, uh, great, (ok, it is a
            tautology), and, usually, prospective employers recognize their greatness quickly, which means, basically,
            they get to work wherever they want, so they honestly don't send out a lot of resumes or apply for a lot of
            jobs.</p>
        <p>Does this sound like the kind of person you want to hire? It should.The corollary of that rule--the rule that
            the great people are never on the market--is that the bad people--the seriously unqualified--are on the
            market quite a lot. They get fired all the time, because they can't do their job. Their companies
            fail--sometimes because any company that would hire them would probably also hire a lot of unqualified
            programmers, so it all adds up to failure--but sometimes because they actually are so unqualified that they
            ruined the company. Yep, it happens.</p>
        <p>These morbidly unqualified people rarely get jobs, thankfully, but they do keep applying, and when they
            apply, they go to Monster.com and check off 300 or 1000 jobs at once trying to win the lottery.</p>
        <p>Astute readers, I expect, will point out that I'm leaving out the largest group yet, the solid, competent
            people. They're on the market more than the great people, but less than the incompetent, and all in all they
            will show up in small numbers in your 1000 resume pile, but for the most part, almost every hiring manager
            in Palo Alto right now with 1000 resumes on their desk has the same exact set of 970 resumes from the same
            minority of 970 incompetent people that are applying for every job in Palo Alto, and probably will be for
            life, and only 30 resumes even worth considering, of which maybe, rarely, one is a great programmer. OK,
            maybe not even one.</p></blockquote>
    <p>Joel's claim is basically that &quot;great&quot; developers won't have that many jobs compared to &quot;bad&quot;
        developers because companies will try to keep &quot;great&quot; developers. Joel also posits that companies can
        recognize prospective &quot;great&quot; developers easily. But these two statements are hard to reconcile. If
        it's so easy to identify prospective &quot;great&quot; developers, why not try to recruit them? You could just
        as easily make the case that &quot;great&quot; developers are overrepresented in the market because they have
        better opportunities and it's the &quot;bad&quot; developers who will cling to their jobs. This kind of adverse
        selection is common in companies that are declining; I saw that in my intern cohort at IBM<sup
                class=footnote-ref id=fnref:I><a rel=footnote href=#fn:I>1</a></sup>, among other places.</p>
    <p>Should &quot;good&quot; developers be overrepresented in the market or underrepresented? If we listen to the
        anecdotal griping about hiring, we might ask if the market for developers is a market for lemons. This idea goes
        back to Akerlof's Nobel prize winning 1970 paper, &quot;<a
                href=http://www.econ.yale.edu/~dirkb/teach/pdf/akerlof/themarketforlemons.pdf>The Market for 'Lemons':
            Quality Uncertainty and the Market Mechanism</a>&quot;. Akerlof takes used car sales as an example,
        splitting the market into good used cars and bad used cars (bad cars are called &quot;lemons&quot;). If there's
        no way to distinguish between good cars and lemons, good cars and lemons will sell for the same price. Since
        buyers can't distinguish between good cars and bad cars, the price they're willing to pay is based on the
        quality of the average in the market. Since owners know if their car is a lemon or not, owners of non-lemons
        won't sell because the average price is driven down by the existence of lemons. This results in a feedback loop
        which causes lemons to be the only thing available.</p>
    <p>This model is certainly different from Joel's model. Joel's model assumes that &quot;great&quot; developers are
        sticky -- that they stay at each job for a long time. This comes from two assumptions; first, that it's easy for
        prospective employers to identify who's &quot;great&quot;, and second, that once someone is identified as &quot;great&quot;,
        their current employer will do anything to keep them (as in the market for lemons). But the first assumption
        alone is enough to prevent the developer job market from being a market for lemons. If you can tell that a <em>potential</em>
        employee is great, you can simply go and offer them twice as much as they're currently making (something that
        I've seen actually happen). You need an information asymmetry to create a market for lemons, and Joel posits
        that there's no information asymmetry.</p>
    <p>If we put aside Joel's argument and look at the job market, there's incomplete information, but both current and
        prospective employers have incomplete information, and whose information is better varies widely. It's actually
        quite common for prospective employers to have better information than current employers!</p>
    <p>Just for example, there's someone I've worked with, let's call him Bob, who's saved two different projects by
        doing the grunt work necessary to keep the project from totally imploding. The projects were both declared
        successes, promotions went out, they did <a href=http://www.paulgraham.com/submarine.html>a big PR blitz which
            involves seeding articles in all the usual suspects; Wired, Fortune</a>, and so on and so forth. That's
        worked out great for the people who are good at taking credit for things, but it hasn't worked out so well for
        Bob. In fact, someone else I've worked with recently mentioned to me that management keeps asking him why Bob
        takes so long to do simple tasks. The answer is that Bob's busy making sure the services he works on don't have
        global outages when they launch, but that's not the kind of thing you get credit for in Bob's org. The result of
        that is that Bob has a network who knows that he's great, which makes it easy for him to get a job anywhere else
        at market rate. But his management chain has no idea, and based on what I've seen of offers today, they're
        paying him about half what he could make elsewhere. There's no shortage of cases where information transfer
        inside a company is so poor that external management has a better view of someone's productivity than internal
        management. I have one particular example in mind, but if I just think of the Bob archetype, off the top of my
        head, I know of four people who are currently in similar situations. It helps that I currently work at a company
        that's notorious for being dysfunctional in this exact way, but this happens everywhere. When I worked at a
        small company, we regularly hired great engineers from big companies that were too clueless to know what kind of
        talent they had.</p>
    <p>Another problem with the idea that &quot;great&quot; developers are sticky is that this assumes that companies
        are capable of creating groups that developers want to work for on demand. This is usually not the case. Just
        for example, I once joined a team where the TL was pretty strongly against using version control or having
        tests. As a result of those (and other) practices, it took five devs one year to produce 10k lines of
        kinda-sorta working code for a straightforward problem. Additionally, it was a pressure cooker where people were
        expected to put in 80+ hour weeks, where the PM would shame people into putting in longer hours. Within a year,
        three of the seven people who were on the team when I joined had left; two of them went to different companies.
        The company didn't want to lose those two people, but it wasn't capable of creating an environment that would
        keep them.</p>
    <p>Around when I joined that team, a friend of mine joined a really great team. They do work that materially impacts
        the world, they have room for freedom and creativity, a large component of their jobs involves learning new and
        interesting things, and so on and so forth. Whenever I heard about someone who was looking for work, I'd forward
        them that team. That team is now full for the foreseeable future because everyone whose network included that
        team forwarded people into that team. But if you look at the team that lost three out of seven people in a year,
        that team is hiring. A lot. The result of this dynamic is that, as a dev, if you join a random team, you're
        overwhelmingly likely to join a team that has a lot of churn. Additionally, if you know of a good team, it's
        likely to be full.</p>
    <p>Joel's model implicitly assumes that, proportionally, there are many more dysfunctional developers than
        dysfunctional work environments.</p>
    <p>At the last conference I attended, I asked most people I met two questions:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Do you know of any companies that aren't highly dysfunctional?</li>
        <li>Do you know of any particular teams that are great and are hiring?</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Not one single person told me that their company meets the criteria in (1). A few people suggested that, maybe,
        Dropbox is ok, or that, maybe, Jane Street is ok, but the answers were of the form &quot;I know a few people
        there and I haven't heard any terrible horror stories yet, plus I sometimes hear good stories&quot;, not &quot;that
        company is great and you should definitely work there&quot;. Most people said that they didn't know of any
        companies that weren't <a href=//danluu.com/wat/ >a total mess</a>.</p>
    <p>A few people had suggestions for (2), but the most common answer was something like &quot;LOL no, if I knew that
        I'd go work there&quot;. The second most common answer was of the form &quot;I know some people on the Google
        Brain team and it sounds great&quot;. There are a few teams that are well known for being great places to work,
        but the fact that they're so few and far between that it's basically impossible to get a job on one of those
        teams. A few people knew of actual teams that they'd strongly recommend who were hiring, but that was rare. Much
        rarer than finding a developer who I'd want to work with who would consider moving. If I flipped the question
        around and asked if they knew of any good developers who were looking for work, the answer was usually &quot;yes&quot;<sup
                class=footnote-ref id=fnref:L><a rel=footnote href=#fn:L>2</a></sup>.</p>
    <p>Another problem with the idea that &quot;great&quot; developers are impossible to find because they join
        companies and then stick is that developers (and companies) aren't immutable. Because I've been lucky enough to
        work in environments that allow people to really flourish, I've seen a lot of people go from unremarkable to
        amazing. Because most companies invest pretty much nothing in helping people, you can do really well here
        without investing much effort.</p>
    <p>On the flip side, I've seen entire teams of devs go on the market because their environment changed. Just for
        example, I used to know <em>a lot</em> of people who worked at company X under <a
                href=https://www.linkedin.com/in/marcyun>Marc Yun</a>. It was the kind of place that has low attrition
        because people really enjoy working there. And then Marc left. Over the next two years, literally everyone I
        knew who worked there left. This one change both created a lemon in the searching-for-a-team job market and put
        a bunch of good developers on the market. This kind of thing happens all the time, even more now than in the
        past because of today's acquisition-heavy environment.</p>
    <p>Is developer hiring a market for lemons? Well, it depends on what you mean by that. Both developers and hiring
        managers have incomplete information. It's not obvious if having a market for lemons in one direction makes the
        other direction better or worse. The fact that joining a new team is uncertain makes developers less likely to
        leave existing teams, which makes it harder to hire developers. But the fact that developers often join teams
        which they dislike makes it easier to hire developers. What's the net effect of that? I have no idea.</p>
    <p>From where I'm standing, it seems really hard to find a good manager/team, and I don't know of any replicable
        strategy for doing so; I have a lot of sympathy for people who can't find a good fit because I get how hard that
        is. But I have seen replicable strategies for hiring, so I don't have nearly as much sympathy for hiring
        managers who complain that hiring &quot;great&quot; developers is impossible.</p>
    <p>When a hiring manager complains about hiring, in every single case I've seen so far, the hiring manager has one
        of the following problems:</p>
    <ol>
        <li><p>They pay too little. The last time I went looking for work, I found a 6x difference in compensation
            between companies who might hire me <em>in the same geographic region</em>. Basically all of the companies
            thought that they were competitive, even when they were at the bottom end of the range. I don't know what it
            is, but companies always seem to think that they pay well, even when they're not even close to being in the
            right range. Almost everyone I talk to tells me that they pay as much as any <em>reasonable</em> company.
            Sure, there are some companies out there that pay a bit more, but they're overpaying! You can actually see
            this if you read Joel's writing -- back when he wrote the post I'm quoting above, he talked about how well
            Fog Creek paid. A couple years later, he complained that Google was overpaying for college kids with no
            experience, and more recently <a href=https://twitter.com/danluu/status/784929052519837696>he's pretty much
                said that you don't want to work at companies that pay well</a>.</li>
        <li><p>They pass on good or even &quot;great&quot; developers<sup class=footnote-ref id=fnref:H><a rel=footnote
                                                                                                           href=#fn:H>3</a></sup>.
            Earlier, I claimed that I knew lots of good developers who are looking for work. You might ask, if there are
            so many good developers looking for work, why's it so hard to find them? Joel claims that out of a 1000
            resumes, maybe 30 people will be &quot;solid&quot; and 970 will be &quot;incompetent&quot;. It seems to me
            it's more like 400 will be solid and 20 will be really good. It's just that almost everyone uses the same
            filters, so everyone ends up fighting over the 30 people who they think are solid. When people do randomized
            trials on what actaully causes resumes to get filtered out, it often turns out that traits that are
            tangentially related or unrelated to job performance make huge differences. For example, <a
                    href=http://www-2.rotman.utoronto.ca/facbios/file/RiveraTilcsik.pdf>in this study of law firm
                recruiting</a>, the authors found that a combination of being male and having &quot;high-class&quot;
            signifiers on the resume (sailing, polo, and classical music instead of track and field, pick-up soccer, and
            country music) with no other changes caused a 4x increase in interview invites.</p>
            <p>The first company I worked at, <a
                    href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01FSZU6FK/ref=as_li_qf_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=abroaview-20&amp;creative=9325&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;creativeASIN=B01FSZU6FK&amp;linkId=d15e514c6ecefa224be8f05d4d5837e3">Centaur</a>,
                had an onsite interview process that was less stringent than the phone screen at places like Google and
                Facebook. If you listen to people like Joel, you'd think that Centaur was full of bozos, but after over
                a decade in industry (including time at Google), Centaur had the best mean and median level of developer
                productivity of any place I've worked.</p>
            <p>Matasano famously solved their hiring problem by using a different set of filters and getting a different
                set of people. Despite the resounding success of their strategy, pretty much everyone insists on
                sticking with the standard strategy of picking people with brand name pedigrees and running basically
                the same interview process as everyone else, <a href=http://danluu.com/programmer-moneyball/ >bidding up
                    the price of folks who are trendy and ignoring everyone else</a>.</p>
            <p>If I look at developers I know who are in high-demand today, a large fraction of them went through a
                multi-year period where they were underemployed and practically begging for interesting work. These
                people are very easy to hire if you can find them.</li>
        <li><p>They're trying to hire for some combination of rare skills. Right now, if you're trying to hire for
            someone with experience in deep learning and, well, anything else, you're going to have a bad time.</li>
        <li><p>They're much more dysfunctional than they realize. I know one hiring manager who complains about how hard
            it is to hire. What he doesn't realize is that literally everyone on his team is bitterly unhappy and a
            significant fraction of his team gives anti-referrals to friends and tells them to stay away.</p>
            <p>That's an extreme case, but it's quite common to see a VP or founder baffled by why hiring is so hard
                when employees consider the place to be mediocre or even bad.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Of these problems, (1), low pay, is both the most common and the simplest to fix.</p>
    <p>In the past few years, Oracle and Alibaba have spun up new cloud computing groups in Seattle. This is a
        relatively competitive area, and both companies have reputations that work against them when hiring<sup
                class=footnote-ref id=fnref:O><a rel=footnote href=#fn:O>4</a></sup>. If you believe the complaints
        about how hard it is to hire, you wouldn't think one company, let alone two, could spin up entire cloud teams in
        Seattle. Both companies solved the problem by paying substantially more than their competitors were offering for
        people with similar experience. Alibaba became known for such generous offers that when I was negotiating my
        offer from Microsoft, MS told me that they'd match an offer from any company except Alibaba. I believe Oracle
        and Alibaba have hired hundreds of engineers over the past few years.</p>
    <p>Most companies don't need to hire anywhere near a hundreds of people; they can pay competitively without hiring
        so many developers that the entire market moves upwards, but they still refuse to do so, while complaining about
        how hard it is to hire.</p>
    <p>(2), filtering out good potential employees, seems like the modern version of &quot;no one ever got fired for
        hiring IBM&quot;. If you hire someone with a trendy background who's good at traditional coding interviews and
        they don't work out, who could blame you? And no one's going to notice all the people you missed out on. Like
        (1), this is something that almost everyone thinks they do well and they'll say things like &quot;we'd have to
        lower our bar to hire more people, and no one wants that&quot;. But I've never worked at a place that doesn't
        filter out a lot of people who end up doing great work elsewhere. I've tried to get underrated programmers<sup
                class=footnote-ref id=fnref:U><a rel=footnote href=#fn:U>5</a></sup> hired at places I've worked, and
        I've literally never succeeded in getting one hired. Once, someone I failed to get hired managed to get a job at
        Google after something like four years being underemployed (and is a star there). That guy then got me hired at
        Google. Not hiring that guy didn't only cost them my brilliant friend, it eventually cost them me!</p>
    <p>BTW, this illustrates a problem with Joel's idea that &quot;great&quot; devs never apply for jobs. There's often
        a long time period where a &quot;great&quot; dev has an extremely hard time getting hired, even through their
        network who knows that they're great, because they don't look like what people think &quot;great&quot;
        developers look like. Additionally, Google, which has heavily studied which hiring channels give good results,
        has found that referrals and internal recommendations don't actually generate much signal. While people will
        refer &quot;great&quot; devs, they'll also refer terrible ones. The referral bonus scheme that most companies
        set up skews incentives in a way that makes referrals worse than you might expect. Because of this and other
        problems, many companies don't weight referrals particularly heavily, and &quot;great&quot; developers still go
        through the normal hiring process, just like everyone else.</p>
    <p>(3), needing a weird combination of skills, can be solved by hiring people with half or a third of the expertise
        you need and training people. People don't seem to need much convincing on this one, and I see this happen all
        the time.</p>
    <p>(4), dysfunction <a href=//danluu.com/learning-to-program/#fixing-totally-broken-danluu-com-wat-situations>seems
        hard to fix</a>. If I knew how to do that, I'd be manager.</p>
    <p>As a dev, it seems to me that teams I know of that are actually good environments that pay well have no problems
        hiring, and that teams that have trouble hiring can pretty easily solve that problem. But I'm biased. I'm not a
        hiring manager. There's probably some hiring manager out there thinking: &quot;every developer I know who
        complains that it's hard to find a good team has one of these four obvious problems; if only my problems were
        that easy to solve!&quot;</p>

            <li id=fn:I>The folks who stayed describe an environment that's mostly missing mid-level people they'd want
                to work with. There are lifers who've been there forever and will be there until retirement, and there
                are new grads who land there at random. But, compared to their competitors, there are relatively few
                people people with 5-15 years of experience. The person I knew who lasted the longest stayed until the 8
                year mark, but he started interviewing with an eye on leaving when he found out the other person on his
                team who was competent was interviewing; neither one wanted to be the only person on the team doing any
                work, so they raced to get out the door first. <a class=footnote-return

            <li id=fn:H><p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8RxkpUvxK0">Moishe Lettvin has a talk I really
                like</a>, where he talks about a time when he was on a hiring committee and they rejected every
                candidate that came up, only to find that the &quot;candidates&quot; were actually anonymized versions
                of their own interviews!</p>
                <p>The bit about when he first started interviewing at Microsoft should sound familiar to MS folks. As
                    is often the case, he got thrown into the interview with no warning and no preparation. He had no
                    idea what to do and, as a result, wrote up interview feedback that wasn't great. &quot;In classic
                    Microsoft style&quot;, his manager forwarded the interview feedback to the entire team and said
                    &quot;don't do this&quot;. &quot;In classic Microsoft style&quot; is a quote from Moishe, but I've
                    observed the same thing. I'd like to talk about how we have a tendency to do <em>extremely
                        blameful</em> postmortems and how that warps incentives, but that probably deserves its own
                    post.</p>
                <p>Well, I'll tell one story, in remembrance of someone who recently left my former team for Google.
                    Shortly after that guy joined, he was in the office on a weekend (a common occurrence on his team).
                    A manager from another team pinged him on chat and asked him to sign off on some code from the other
                    team. The new guy, wanting to be helpful, signed off on the code. On Monday, the new guy talked to
                    his mentor and his mentor suggested that he not help out other teams like that. Later, there was an
                    outage related to the code. In classic Microsoft style, the manager from the other team successfully
                    pushed the blame for the outage from his team to the new guy.</p>
                <p>Note that this guy isn't included in my 3/7 stat because he joined shortly after I did, and I'm not
                    trying to cherry pick a window with the highest possible attrition.</p> <a class=footnote-return
                                                                                               href=#fnref:H><sup>[return]</sup></a>
            </li>
            <li id=fn:O>For a while, Oracle claimed that the culture of the Seattle office is totally different from
                mainline-Oracle culture, but from what I've heard, they couldn't resist Oracle-ifying the Seattle group
                and that part of the pitch is no longer convincing. <a class=footnote-return
                                                                       href=#fnref:O><sup>[return]</sup></a></li>
            <li id=fn:U><p>This footnote is a response to Ben Kuhn, who asked me, what types of devs are underrated and
                how would you find them? I think this group is diverse enough that there's no one easy way to find them.
                There are people like &quot;Bob&quot;, who do critical work that's simply not noticed. There are also
                people who are just terrible at interviewing, like <a
                        href=https://www.linkedin.com/in/jeshua-smith-1a873858>Jeshua Smith</a>. I believe he's only
                once gotten a performance review that wasn't excellent (that semester, his manager said he could only
                give out one top rating, and it wouldn't be fair to give it to only one of his two top performers, so he
                gave them both average ratings). In every place he's worked, he's been well known as someone who you can
                go to with hard problems or questions, and much higher ranking engineers often go to him for help. I
                tried to get him hired at two different companies I've worked at and he failed both interviews. He sucks
                at interviews. My understanding is that his interview performance almost kept him from getting his
                current job, but his references were so numerous and strong that his current company decided to take a
                chance on him anyway. But he only had those references because his old org has been disintegrating. His
                new company picked up <em>a lot</em> of people from his old company, so there were many people at the
                new company that knew him. He can't get the time of day almost anywhere else. Another person I've tried
                and failed to get hired is someone I'll call Ashley, who got rejected in the recruiter screening phase
                at Google for not being technical enough, despite my internal recommendation that she was one of the
                strongest programmers I knew. But she came from a &quot;nontraditional&quot; background that didn't fit
                the recruiter's idea of what a programmer looked like, so that was that. Nontraditional is a funny term
                because it seems like most programmers have a &quot;nontraditional&quot; background, but you know what I
                mean.</p>
                <p>There's enough variety here that there isn't one way to find all of these people. Having a filtering
                    process that's more like Matasano's and less like Google, Microsoft, Facebook, almost any YC startup
                    you can name, etc., is probably a good start.</p> <a class=footnote-return href=#fnref:U><sup>[return]</sup></a>
