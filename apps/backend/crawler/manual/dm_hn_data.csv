jmmv,1281,"<a href=""https://jmmv.dev/"">https://jmmv.dev/</a><p>You probably have seen this in the front page sometime last week due to the ""Fast machines, slow machines"" post :)</p>
<p>I started this blog during exams session back in university and I'll reach the 20-year mark next year. Wow. I write about my own projects, but also tech in general based on my current interests, which at the moment are around Rust, Bazel (again), and Unix systems in general.</p>
<p>It's interesting how the blog has changed: I used to write short posts almost daily describing whatever I had been tinkering with in open source projects (back when I contributed to NetBSD and Gnome regularly)... or whatever crossed my mind really. These days, most of those misc posts go into social media, and the blog is reserved for purposeful articles, which end up being much longer (and thus infrequent).</p>
<p>Commenting on the blog used to be much more common years ago, but these days discussion happen off-site in either social media or here. Similarly, people used to visit the blog periodically, but these days nobody does: traffic to the blog is either from organic searches or from spikes due to referrals from sites like HN.</p>
<p>As for how I build it: the posts are written in Markdown; I use Hugo to generate the site; Bootstrap for styling; and my custom web service (EndTRACKER) to offer email subscriptions, post voting and commenting, as well as privacy-respecting analytics.</p>",https://jmmv.dev/,https://jmmv.dev/feed.xml,Costs exposed: On-call ticket handling,https://jmmv.dev/2023/08/costs-exposed-on-call-ticket-handling.html,2023-08-26 14:20:00 UTC

<p>- <a href=""https://daveon.design/what-are-you-optimising-for.html"">https://daveon.design/what-are-you-optimising-for.html</a> - How managers ask for something and get something else, but think they're doing a good job</p>
<p>- <a href=""https://daveon.design/creating-joy-in-the-user-experience.html"">https://daveon.design/creating-joy-in-the-user-experience.ht...</a> - UX design often looks lovely, but what is it missing? Joy.</p>
<p>- <a href=""https://daveon.design/metrics-and-mistakes.html"">https://daveon.design/metrics-and-mistakes.html</a> - on measuring things... and poetry.</p>
<p>I'm particularly happy with the design of the site: I'd love to hear what readers think of the layout and typography. My CSS style is called 'manuscript' and it's very inspired by older book and manuscript look and feel.</p>

boricj,388,"<a href=""https://boricj.net/"">https://boricj.net/</a><p>About two months ago, there was an Ask HN about the most interesting interesting tech you built for just yourself [1]. In this topic, I shared about my Ghidra modifications to unlink pieces of an executable back into relocatable object files [2] in an effort to reverse-engineer a PlayStation 1 video game.</p>
<p>Long story short, I've wanted to write about this esoteric but powerful technique and it snowballed into starting my own blog with a series of articles about reverse-engineering. It's still a WIP draft, quite rough around the edges and not ready for prime-time, but you only have that kind of Ask HN thread once (every couple of years I assume).</p>
<p>Side-note: the Google and Bing webcrawlers managed to find and index that domain name despite having no public links to it whatsoever (to my knowledge) until now, my only logical explanation is that they've found it by scrapping the WHOIS database. It's also hosted inside my home on my personal Synology DS218 NAS with a rather dodgy setup, which will probably crash and burn under any level of load by the time you've read this comment.</p>

OliveMate,114,"I feel a tad awkward because 1) I only started this last week 2) I'm not super tech-y or owt like everyone else here, I'm just a bloke who knows his limits.

<p>It's for expressing general thoughts really, and it serves as a fun trial by fire as every little change inevitably runs into problems, but it's a nice learning experience.

danbartlett,4,"<a href=""https://nobt.co.uk"">https://nobt.co.uk</a><p>It's only a few months old, but I kicked off the blog by sharing the story of my last three years: going through divorce, burnout and depression as a cofounder, in the midst of the pandemic.</p>
<p>The first part of the story is here: <a href=""https://www.nobt.co.uk/p/three-years-part-one"">https://www.nobt.co.uk/p/three-years-part-one</a></p>
<p>I'm using this story as a springboard to understand burnout, explore recovery, and circle the bigger topics of meaning and fulfilment in work.</p>

alexwlchan,60,"<a href=""https://alexwlchan.net/writing/"">https://alexwlchan.net/writing/</a><p>I passed 400 posts a month or so ago; been writing for about a decade. It's a mix of programming, arty stuff, digital preservation, personal thoughts â the first link describes the sort of writing I do, and examples of each.</p>
<p>Some favourites:</p>
<p>* <a href=""https://alexwlchan.net/2022/screenshots/"">https://alexwlchan.net/2022/screenshots/</a> â You should take more screenshots, a perennial darling of HN</p>

voberoi,418,"<a href=""https://vikramoberoi.com"">https://vikramoberoi.com</a><p>I started writing publicly late last year. It's been tons of effort but it's been tremendously fun and fruitful.</p>
<p>Some of my more-visited or favorite posts:</p>
<p>* A primer on Roaring bitmaps: what they are and how they work -- <a href=""https://vikramoberoi.com/a-primer-on-roaring-bitmaps-what-they-are-and-how-they-work/"">https://vikramoberoi.com/a-primer-on-roaring-bitmaps-what-th...</a>. This one ended up on the front page of HN and gets hundreds of visits monthly. I wrote it because it's the post I would have liked to read instead of reading the papers themselves.</p>
<p>* An internship working on ""Customers who bought this also bought"" at Amazon 16 years ago -- <a href=""https://vikramoberoi.com/an-internship-working-on-customers-who-bought-this-also-bought-at-amazon-16-years-ago/"">https://vikramoberoi.com/an-internship-working-on-customers-...</a>. I wrote this one as an addendum to throwaway tweet I posted that went viral.</p>
<p>* How I made atariemailarchive.org --
 <a href=""https://vikramoberoi.com/how-i-made-atariemailarchive-org/"">https://vikramoberoi.com/how-i-made-atariemailarchive-org/</a>. I wrote this one when I open-sourced the dataset behind atariemailarchive.org. The dataset got featured in Data is Plural and in a podcast interview I did with Jeremy Singer-Vine.</p>

<p>My favorite personal blog to read this past year is Phil Eaton's (eatonphil on HN): <a href=""https://notes.eatonphil.com/"">https://notes.eatonphil.com/</a>.</p>
<p>I enjoy the subject matter he posts about (a lot of systems work and research, primarily), but his other posts are great too.</p>
<p>His post, ""Is it worth writing about?"" is a nice inspirational one for folks who want to/have been thinking about writing: <a href=""https://notes.eatonphil.com/is-it-worth-writing-about.html"">https://notes.eatonphil.com/is-it-worth-writing-about.html</a>.</p>",https://vikramoberoi.com,https://vikramoberoi.com/rss/,How many concurrent conversations can you sustain before you hit OpenAI's rate limits?,https://vikramoberoi.com/how-many-concurrent-chats-can-you-support-before-you-hit-openais-rate-limits/,2023-08-11 20:27:22 UTC
